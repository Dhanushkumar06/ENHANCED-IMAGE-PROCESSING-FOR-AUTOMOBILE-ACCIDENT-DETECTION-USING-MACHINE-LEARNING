Road accidents are a significant global concern, 
often resulting in loss of life and property damage. Utilizing the 
YOLO algorithm in an accident detection and reporting 
system is an innovative approach to enhancing road safety. 
YOLO, is an advanced object recognition system that operates 
in real-time video feeds. This technology employs the YOLO 
algorithm to identify accidents and promptly alert emergency 
services, reducing response times and increasing the potential 
for lifesaving interventions. The system comprises two vital 
components: object detection and an alert system. In the object 
detection module, the YOLO method is used to identify 
accidents in live video streams. For precise accident 
recognition, the system is trained using a dedicated module 
containing accident-related images. When an accident is 
detected, the alert system activates, quickly notifying 
emergency services about the accident's location and providing 
an image of the incident. This information is transmitted via a 
wireless communication network, expediting response times 
and improving the chances of saving lives. The system 
underwent rigorous testing using an accident module and 
photos, yielding promising results. The YOLO algorithm 
achieved an accuracy rate of approximately 95% in accident 
detection, with the alarm system consistently responding 
within seconds. To bolster traffic safety, the system can be 
strategically deployed at busy intersections, highways, and 
other high-risk areas. Implementing crash detection and 
warning systems based on the YOLO technique in real-time 
video streams can effectively identify accidents, promptly alert 
emergency services, and improve the chances of saving lives.
